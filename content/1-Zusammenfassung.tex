\label{cha:Zusammenfassung}

Aim of this interface specification is to couple information systems for rental vehicles with travel information systems.
The reason for the coupling is to serve the trend driven requirement of creating intermodal travel chains in order to integrate rental systems to travel information systems.

The specification consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item A Role Model of the involved partners,
\item A recommendation for a service hierarchy of information exchange with different qualities,
\item Interaction sequences to depict message ordering between the partners in order to serve the information coupling based on the specified service levels,
\item The specification of the Data Model for messages of the interaction protocol,
\item Specification of suited technologies to visualize data, the communication between: the information systems, the implementation of the interaction protocol and the concluding information handling which are to be linked
\item Tables of allowed values for enumerations.
\end{itemize}
