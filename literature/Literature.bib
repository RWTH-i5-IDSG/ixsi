@inproceedings{Chowaw-Liebman2010,
abstract = {Until now navigation aids have primarily focused on outdoor scenarios, whether driving on highways or, more recently, walking through cities. These systems use the Global Positioning System (GPS) for position information. Indoor navigation however cannot rely on GPS data, as the signals do not penetrate building structure. Thus other techniques were developed to provide position information indoors, but most of them lack the precision of GPS. In this article the approach of an indoor navigation system based on imprecise position information is presented. To compensate the deficit of precision the position information is combined with a movement model. This movement model is automatically generated from the maps which are already required for navigation.},
