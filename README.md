[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RWTH-i5-IDSG/ixsi.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/RWTH-i5-IDSG/ixsi)



IXSI is a interface for exchanging information  between a Travel Information System and a Ride Sharing System (Carsharing, Bikesharing).
This repository contains the documentation written in TeX. To generate the pdf:

``` 
git clone https://github.com/RWTH-i5-IDSG/ixsi.git
cd ixsi
xml/generate-tex-from-schema.sh
make
``` 

a recent TexLive version is recommended for building.

to automatically update the generated part on pull/merge or checkout you can add the respective script as a local hook:

```
echo "`git rev-parse --git-dir`/../xml/generate-tex-from-schema.sh" >> .git/hooks/post-checkout
echo "`git rev-parse --git-dir`/../xml/generate-tex-from-schema.sh" >> .git/hooks/post-merge
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-{checkout,merge}
```
IXSI is currently still under development and the API is not final.
